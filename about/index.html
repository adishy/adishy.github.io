I am an immigrant two times over - I was born in India but grew up in the middle-east (Oman) and studied in the U.S: I did my undergrad in Computer Science at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, and graduated in May 2021.</p><p>During my time at university, my work experience has primarily been as a full-stack web developer, primarily having written and maintained large applications that use Python Flask and Ruby on Rails. In the past, I have worked at the <a href=ai.umich.edu>Center for Academic Innovation at the University of Michigan</a> and I have also interned at Apple.</p><p>I am an ardent believer in technology and its potential for building a better future for humanity. I think technology's ability to do this hinges on a few key issues such as privacy, the absence of censorship and the continued expansion of the open-source mentality - both within software development as well as in many other spheres of creation.</p><p>In light of this, it may not come as a huge surprise that I am an absolute sucker for all things science fiction and cyberpunk. My favorites include TV shows such as <em>The Expanse</em> and <em>Altered Carbon</em> & Andy Weir novels such as <em>The Martian</em>. I also enjoy hip-hop in its many incarnations (and in many languages, English or otherwise). In my spare time I like to read and I sometimes dabble in digital illustration and animation.</p><p>If you wish to reach out, please contact me at: website &lt;at> adishy &lt;dot> com</p></div></article><hr><div class=post-info></div></main></div><footer class=footer><div class=heartrate_heartbeat_client_container></div><script src=https://adishy.com/js/heartrate_heartbeat_client.js></script>
