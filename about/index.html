I am Aditya, a software developer based in Champaign, IL, currently working at Yahoo. I am an immigrant two times over - I was born in India but grew up in the middle-east (Oman) and studied in the U.S: I did my undergrad in Computer Science at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, and graduated in May 2021.
During my time at university, my work experience has primarily been as a full-stack web developer, primarily having written and maintained large applications that use Python Flask and Ruby on Rails."><meta name=keywords content="Aditya Shylesh"><meta name=robots content="noodp"><meta name=theme-color content><link rel=canonical href=https://adishy.com/about/><title>:: Aditya Shylesh â€” Aditya Shylesh</title><link href=https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/flag-icon-css/3.5.0/css/flag-icon.min.css rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://adishy.com/main.c46cbca46fa76c0fcd3da8313ecf4adee5fb3ffb0288c0902d7e90aead220d79.css><link rel=stylesheet type=text/css href=css/custom.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=https://adishy.com/apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=https://adishy.com/favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=https://adishy.com/favicon-16x16.png><link rel=manifest href=https://adishy.com/site.webmanifest><link rel=mask-icon href=https://adishy.com/safari-pinned-tab.svg color=#1b1c1d><link rel="shortcut icon" href=https://adishy.com/favicon.ico><meta name=msapplication-TileColor content="#1b1c1d"><meta name=theme-color content="#1b1c1d"><meta itemprop=name content><meta itemprop=description content="Hello there!

I am an immigrant two times over - I was born in India but grew up in the middle-east (Oman) and studied in the U.S: I did my undergrad in Computer Science at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, and graduated in May 2021.</p><p>During my time at university, my work experience has primarily been as a full-stack web developer, primarily having written and maintained large applications that use Python Flask and Ruby on Rails. In the past, I have worked at the <a href=ai.umich.edu>Center for Academic Innovation at the University of Michigan</a> and I have also interned at Apple.</p><p>I am an ardent believer in technology and its potential for building a better future for humanity. I think technology&rsquo;s ability to do this hinges on a few key issues such as privacy, the absence of censorship and the continued expansion of the open-source mentality - both within software development as well as in many other spheres of creation.</p><p>In light of this, it may not come as a huge surprise that I am an absolute sucker for all things science fiction and cyberpunk. My favorites include TV shows such as <em>The Expanse</em> and <em>Altered Carbon</em> & Andy Weir novels such as <em>The Martian</em>. I also enjoy hip-hop in its many incarnations (and in many languages, English or otherwise). In my spare time I like to read and I sometimes dabble in digital illustration and animation.</p><p>If you wish to reach out, please contact me at: website &lt;at> adishy &lt;dot> com</p></div></article><hr><div class=post-info></div></main></div><footer class=footer></footer></div><script type=text/javascript src=https://adishy.com/bundle.min.599099f1f14b78b657d524b28e10e0c5098e7cd46e9c7aed73d577068a276c3ff1bb234cbf29cb313333e83cf411727b43157c91ce5b809e2ffc81664614608e.js integrity="sha512-WZCZ8fFLeLZX1SSyjhDgxQmOfNRunHrtc9V3BoonbD/xuyNMvynLMTMz6Dz0EXJ7QxV8kc5bgJ4v/IFmRhRgjg=="></script></body></html>
