## Hello there!

Thanks for stopping by my slice of the internet.

I am Aditya, a software developer based in Champaign, IL, currently working at Yahoo. I am an immigrant two times over - I was born in India but grew up in the middle-east (Oman) and studied in the U.S: I did my undergrad in Computer Science at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, and graduated in May 2021. 

During my time at university, my work experience has primarily been as a full-stack web developer, primarily having written and maintained large applications that use Python Flask and Ruby on Rails. In the past, I have worked at the [Center for Academic Innovation at the University of Michigan](ai.umich.edu) and I have also interned at Apple. 

I am an ardent believer in technology and its potential for building a better future for humanity. I think technology's ability to do this hinges on a few key issues such as privacy, the absence of censorship and the continued expansion of the open-source mentality - both within software development as well as in many other spheres of creation.

In light of this, it may not come as a huge surprise that I am an absolute sucker for all things science fiction and cyberpunk. My favorites include TV shows such as *The Expanse* and *Altered Carbon* & Andy Weir novels such as *The Martian*. I also enjoy hip-hop in its many incarnations (and in many languages, English or otherwise). In my spare time I like to read and I sometimes dabble in digital illustration and animation.
