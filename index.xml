Thanks for stopping by my slice of the internet.
I am Aditya, a software developer based in Champaign, IL, currently working at Yahoo. I am an immigrant two times over - I was born in India but grew up in the middle-east (Oman) and studied in the U.S: I did my undergrad in Computer Science at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, and graduated in May 2021. During my time at university, my work experience has primarily been as a full-stack web developer, primarily having written and maintained large applications that use Python Flask and Ruby on Rails.</description></item></channel></rss>
